The Evolving Landscape of RAG and GraphRAG Evaluation: Datasets, Metrics, and Strategic Imperatives1. Executive Summary: The Evolving Landscape of RAG and GraphRAG Evaluation1.1. OverviewThe assessment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has matured from rudimentary fact-checking to a sophisticated, multi-dimensional discipline. A comprehensive evaluation requires a dual focus, systematically assessing both the retrieval component—the mechanism responsible for identifying relevant information—and the generation component—the large language model (LLM) that synthesizes the final response. The efficacy of the entire pipeline is contingent on the seamless, high-quality performance of both stages.1.2. Key FindingsThe evaluation of RAG is not a monolithic task but a nuanced process that leverages a spectrum of datasets, each designed to probe a specific capability. Foundational question-answering datasets such as Natural Questions and MS MARCO provide a robust benchmark for open-domain retrieval, while modern benchmarks like HotpotQA and RAGBench challenge systems on complex reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, respectively. The field is experiencing a significant shift away from traditional, string-matching metrics like BLEU and ROUGE toward more semantically aware, reference-free methods. This methodological evolution, particularly the emergence of the "LLM-as-a-judge" framework, is becoming the gold standard for its ability to provide nuanced and actionable feedback.1.3. RAG vs. GraphRAGA core finding from recent research is that RAG and GraphRAG are not competing paradigms but are fundamentally complementary. The analysis reveals that while traditional RAG often excels at single-hop, detailed fact retrieval, GraphRAG demonstrates superior performance on complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. For summarization, traditional RAG captures fine-grained details, whereas GraphRAG generates more diverse and multi-faceted summaries due to its ability to model relationships within data. This suggests that the future of RAG systems lies not in a single architecture but in an adaptive approach that intelligently selects the optimal retrieval method based on query intent.1.4. Methodological ShiftTraditional metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, primarily measure n-gram overlap between generated and reference text, which fails to account for semantic similarity or paraphrasing. This limitation has spurred the adoption of modern, embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Tools and frameworks like RAGAS and those integrated into platforms such as Amazon Bedrock use a powerful LLM to evaluate a RAG system's output on criteria such as faithfulness, relevancy, and completeness. This paradigm allows for a more granular and diagnostic assessment, which is essential for continuous improvement in production environments.1.5. Strategic ImperativesThe primary challenges in RAG evaluation, including the persistence of hallucinations and the limitations of static datasets, necessitate a strategic shift for practitioners. The existence of dedicated datasets for hallucination analysis, such as RAGTruth, and dynamic benchmarks like DRAGON highlights the importance of moving beyond a singular focus on performance scores. A holistic approach is required, one that considers not just accuracy, but also practical constraints such as latency, cost, and the crucial alignment of evaluation metrics with real-world user needs. A comprehensive evaluation framework should be diagnostic, designed to pinpoint specific failure modes within the RAG pipeline.2. The Foundations of RAG Evaluation: Datasets for Core CapabilitiesThe evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation has been built upon a series of foundational datasets, each addressing a specific challenge in natural language processing and information retrieval. These benchmarks have served as the proving grounds for new architectures, moving from simple question-answering to complex reasoning and domain-specific applications.2.1. Foundational Benchmarks: Open-Domain Question Answering and Retrieval2.1.1. Natural Questions (NQ): Benchmarking Real-World QueriesNatural Questions is a seminal dataset designed for the training and evaluation of automatic question-answering systems.1 Its core value lies in its authenticity: the dataset consists of real, anonymized user queries issued to the Google search engine, which provides a more genuine representation of human information-seeking behavior than synthetically generated queries.1 These questions are paired with answers found from Wikipedia pages by human annotators.1The structure of the dataset is particularly insightful. Annotators are tasked with identifying a "long answer," defined as the smallest HTML bounding box (e.g., a paragraph, list, or table row) that contains all the necessary information to infer the answer.1 They also identify a "short answer," which consists of one or more specific entities.1 The public release of NQ includes a large training set of over 300,000 examples with single annotations and development and test sets with five-way annotations, which allows for more robust evaluation of model performance against a variety of acceptable answers.22.1.2. MS MARCO: Scaling Information RetrievalMS MARCO, or Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension, is a collection of large-scale datasets focused on deep learning in search.3 Its questions, like those in NQ, are derived from real, anonymized Bing user queries.4 However, its primary purpose is to scale information retrieval tasks, specifically passage and document ranking, with its corpus containing millions of documents and passages.3The dataset is invaluable for evaluating the retrieval component of a RAG system, independent of the generation aspect.3 Metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@10) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) are commonly used to assess how effectively models can rank the most relevant passages for a given query.3 The MS MARCO Passage Ranking task, in particular, is a standard benchmark for training and evaluating models like cross-encoders, which are designed to re-rank passages based on relevance to a query.3 This focus on the retriever helps developers build efficient search systems that can handle large document collections.32.2. Beyond Fact Retrieval: Datasets for Complex Reasoning2.2.1. HotpotQA: The Multi-Hop ChallengeWhile datasets like NQ excel at single-query fact retrieval, they do not sufficiently challenge a model's ability to reason across multiple documents. HotpotQA was created to fill this gap, offering a dataset for multi-hop question answering that requires models to find and synthesize information from multiple supporting documents to form a complete answer.5A unique and valuable feature of HotpotQA is its explicit supervision for "supporting facts," which are specific sentences within the source documents that justify the answer.5 This feature is a significant innovation as it enables the evaluation of explainability, allowing researchers to assess not only if a model arrives at the correct answer but also if it follows the correct reasoning path.5 The dataset offers two distinct evaluation settings: a "distractor setting" where the model must choose from a limited set of ten paragraphs, and a more challenging "fullwiki setting" that requires open-domain retrieval from the entire Wikipedia corpus.72.2.2. 2WikiMultiHopQA: Advancing ExplainabilityBuilding on the work of HotpotQA, the 2WikiMultiHopQA dataset was introduced to address two specific limitations in previous multi-hop datasets: the lack of a complete explanation for the reasoning process and the presence of questions that could be answered without true multi-hop reasoning.8 By carefully designing a pipeline with a set of templates and logical rules, this dataset guarantees that each question genuinely requires multi-hop steps to be answered.8 It leverages structured and unstructured data, including information from Wikidata, to ensure the questions are natural while still requiring complex reasoning.82.3. Modern and Domain-Specific Benchmarks2.3.1. RAGBench: Bridging Academia and IndustryRAGBench is a large-scale, comprehensive RAG benchmark dataset with 100,000 examples that is particularly relevant for industry applications.9 The examples are sourced from industry corpora, such as user manuals, which provides a more practical and realistic testbed than generic, open-domain knowledge bases.9Its key innovation is the use of "explainable labels" (e.g., relevance, utilization, and completeness), which provide a holistic evaluation of the RAG system and offer actionable feedback for continuous improvement in production applications.9 For example, a low "utilization" score would indicate that the retrieved context was not adequately used by the LLM, pinpointing a specific failure mode in the generation stage.10 This moves the evaluation from a simple quantitative score to a qualitative, diagnostic assessment.92.3.2. MRAG-Bench: The Multimodal FrontierMRAG-Bench extends the RAG evaluation paradigm into the multimodal domain.11 This benchmark is specifically designed to assess Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in their ability to retrieve and utilize visual information, which is often more beneficial or easier to access than textual data in certain scenarios.11 The dataset comprises over 16,000 images and more than 1,300 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across nine distinct scenarios.11 Evaluations on MRAG-Bench have confirmed that visually augmented knowledge is more helpful than textual knowledge for LVLMs, highlighting the benchmark's value in encouraging the development of models that can effectively leverage retrieved visual knowledge.112.4. A Progression from Simple Correctness to Diagnostic PrecisionThe progression of these foundational datasets illustrates a profound evolution in the understanding of what constitutes a "correct" RAG system. The journey began with simple, binary ground truths. The Natural Questions dataset defined truth as a single, human-annotated long or short answer.1 This provided a straightforward, albeit limited, measure of a model's ability to locate a correct answer.The next step in this progression was the introduction of a more complex notion of truth. HotpotQA's use of "supporting facts" required a model to not only provide a correct answer but also to justify that answer by citing the specific source material.5 This approach began to link the quality of the generated output to the quality of the retrieval, moving beyond a simple pass/fail system to a more nuanced assessment.The final and most significant step is represented by benchmarks like RAGBench, which introduced multi-faceted diagnostic labels.9 A RAG system's output is no longer simply "correct" or "incorrect." Instead, it is evaluated on dimensions like "relevance," "utilization," and "completeness".9 A system might produce a correct answer but fail on "utilization" because it relied on its internal knowledge rather than the retrieved context. This type of diagnostic feedback is invaluable for an engineer, as it pinpoints the exact failure mode within the pipeline. This evolution demonstrates a fundamental shift in the evaluation of RAG: it is moving from a system that asks, "Is the answer right?" to one that asks, "What part of the process failed, and how do we fix it?"Table 1: Foundational and Specialized RAG DatasetsDatasetPrimary PurposeSource DomainKey FeaturesPrimary MetricsNatural Questions (NQ)Open-domain QAGoogle Search Queries, WikipediaReal user questions; long and short answers; human-annotatedF1, Exact MatchMS MARCOInformation Retrieval/Passage RankingBing Search Queries, Web DocumentsLarge scale (~8.8M passages); derived from real user queriesMRR@10, NDCG@10HotpotQAMulti-hop Reasoning/QAWikipediaRequires finding and reasoning over multiple documents; provides supporting facts for explainabilityF1, Exact Match (EM), Supporting FactsRAGBenchDomain-specific EvaluationIndustry Corpora (e.g., user manuals)Large scale (100k examples); explainable labels (relevance, utilization, completeness) for actionable feedbackAUROC, RMSE (for labels), Hallucination PredictionMRAG-BenchMultimodal RAG/LVLM EvaluationImages, Text, Annotated QuestionsEvaluates visual knowledge retrieval; 9 distinct scenarios; assesses LVLMsAccuracy3. The GraphRAG Evaluation Landscape: A Complementary ParadigmAs the RAG paradigm has matured, a specialized approach known as GraphRAG has emerged. This section explores its unique evaluation landscape, its dedicated benchmarks, and the systematic comparison that redefines its relationship with traditional RAG.3.1. Understanding Graph-Based RetrievalGraphRAG is a specialized form of RAG that leverages graph structures, such as knowledge graphs, to model and retrieve information.12 Unlike traditional RAG, which treats documents as a linear collection of chunks, GraphRAG structures information as interconnected nodes and edges, capturing the relationships between entities, concepts, and documents.12 This approach is particularly effective at handling complex queries that require traversing multiple relationships, a task that can be challenging for linear, text-based retrieval methods.123.2. GraphRAG-Bench: A Diagnostic BenchmarkTo address the lack of systematic evaluation for GraphRAG, the GraphRAG-Bench benchmark was proposed.16 Its core purpose is to investigate the critical question of when and in which scenarios graph structures provide a measurable benefit for RAG systems.16 The benchmark features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, covering a range of capabilities from simple fact retrieval to complex reasoning and even creative generation.16GraphRAG-Bench also includes two domain-specific leaderboards: one for literary/fictional content and another for medical/healthcare content.16 The evaluation is performed across four key dimensions:Fact Retrieval: Measured by Accuracy and ROUGE-L.Complex Reasoning: Also measured by Accuracy and ROUGE-L.Contextual Summarization: Evaluated by Accuracy and Coverage.Creative Generation: Assessed using Accuracy, Factual Score, and Coverage.163.3. RAG vs. GraphRAG: A Systematic EvaluationRecent research has conducted a systematic evaluation comparing traditional RAG and GraphRAG on widely adopted datasets for Question Answering and Query-based Summarization.12 The findings from this analysis offer a crucial perspective, demonstrating that the two methodologies are not mutually exclusive or a simple matter of one superseding the other. Instead, they are fundamentally complementary, each possessing distinct strengths that make them more suitable for different types of tasks.123.3.1. Question AnsweringIn the context of question answering, the evaluation revealed clear and distinct strengths for each approach. Traditional RAG, which relies on semantic similarity to retrieve text chunks, performs better on single-hop questions and those requiring specific, fine-grained details.12 This is because it excels at identifying and retrieving the most semantically similar text passages, which is a highly effective strategy for answering direct questions. In contrast, GraphRAG is more effective for multi-hop questions where the answer requires traversing a reasoning path across multiple connected data points.12 Its ability to model relationships between entities and documents gives it a clear advantage when a query cannot be answered from a single, isolated chunk of text.3.3.2. Query-Based SummarizationWhen tasked with query-based summarization, the differences between the two methods become even more apparent. The traditional RAG approach tends to capture fine-grained details from the retrieved text, often producing summaries that are highly factual and specific to the source material.12 GraphRAG, by contrast, generates summaries that are more diverse and multi-faceted. This is a direct result of its ability to connect disparate facts and concepts from across the knowledge base, enabling it to synthesize a more comprehensive and holistic overview.123.4. Reframing the Debate: An Adaptive ParadigmThe most significant takeaway from the systematic comparison of RAG and GraphRAG is that the prevailing notion of them as competing paradigms is a false dichotomy. The evidence indicates that the choice between them is not "which is better" but rather, "which is best for this specific task?" This understanding leads to a new architectural consideration for future RAG systems.A high-performing, next-generation system would not be a pure RAG or a pure GraphRAG but an adaptive, hybrid model. Such a system would employ an intelligent router that analyzes the user's query and determines the optimal retrieval strategy. For a simple, single-hop question like "What is the capital of France?", it would route the query to a traditional, vector-based retrieval system, which is fast and efficient at finding a direct answer. However, for a complex, multi-hop question like "What is the relationship between the company that developed this product and the company that manufactured the raw materials?", the system would intelligently route the query to a graph traversal engine, which is purpose-built to navigate and synthesize relationships. This strategic design moves the field beyond a simple technology choice to a sophisticated architectural challenge, where a system can dynamically leverage the strengths of multiple retrieval methods to maximize performance across a diverse range of query types.Table 2: A Comparative Analysis: RAG vs. GraphRAGAspectTraditional RAGGraphRAGOptimal Use CaseSingle-hop QAExcels; better performance on direct, fact-based questionsUnderperforms; struggles to compete with direct retrievalQueries requiring a single, specific fact.Multi-hop QAStruggles; often misses connections between factsExcels; more effective at traversing relationships to find an answerQueries requiring synthesis of information from multiple sources.Fine-grained SummarizationCaptures detailed information; produces highly specific summariesMay lose fine-grained details in favor of broader contextTasks requiring concise, detailed summaries of a specific document or context.Diverse SummarizationLimited; summaries are often restricted to the retrieved contextExcels; connects disparate concepts for a more holistic summaryTasks requiring a broad overview or synthesis of a topic from a variety of sources.Capturing Data RelationshipsLinear; relationships are implicit in the textStructured; relationships are explicit nodes and edgesApplications in legal, medical, or technical domains where relationships are critical.4. A Framework for Evaluation: Metrics and MethodologyThe effectiveness of RAG systems is not measured by a single metric but by a comprehensive framework that assesses both the retrieval and generation components of the pipeline. The field has evolved from relying on simple word-overlap metrics to sophisticated, semantically aware, and diagnostic evaluation methods.4.1. Separating the Pipeline: Retrieval vs. Generation MetricsTo properly diagnose system failures, it is essential to evaluate the retriever and the generator independently.4.1.1. Retrieval Metrics: Assessing Context QualityThese metrics evaluate the retriever's ability to find relevant documents or passages, assessing the quality of the context before it is passed to the LLM.17 They can be divided into two main categories:Order-Unaware Metrics: Metrics like precision@k, recall@k, and F1@k measure the presence of relevant items in the top k results, regardless of their position in the list.18 For example, recall@k measures the proportion of all relevant documents that were successfully retrieved within the top k results, which is crucial in high-stakes fields like legal research where overlooking a relevant precedent would be costly.18Order-Aware Metrics: These metrics penalize a system for placing relevant items lower in the ranked list.18 Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is well-suited for systems where the position of the single best result is most important, as it calculates the average position of the first relevant item across all queries.19 Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is a more nuanced metric that accounts for graded relevance, assigning higher scores to relevant items that appear at the top of the list.18 NDCG is ideal for applications like recommendation systems where the quality of the entire ranked list matters.184.1.2. Generation Metrics: Assessing Output QualityThese metrics evaluate the final response from the LLM based on the retrieved context.17Faithfulness (Groundedness): The Paramount Metric: Faithfulness is arguably the most critical metric for RAG systems. It measures whether the generated response is completely supported by the provided context, thereby quantifying the system's hallucination rate.10 A high faithfulness score indicates that the output is grounded and trustworthy.21Answer Relevancy and Correctness: Answer Relevancy assesses if the generated answer is on-topic and directly addresses the user's query.17 Correctness, on the other hand, measures the alignment of the generated answer with a ground-truth answer, assuming one is available.19Completeness and Utilization: Diagnostic Metrics: Completeness measures if the response addresses all parts of the user's query, while utilization measures the extent to which the retrieved context was used in the final response.10 These metrics are invaluable for diagnosing pipeline failures, as a low completeness score could indicate that the retriever failed to find all the necessary information, while a low utilization score could suggest that the LLM ignored the provided context.104.2. The Emergence of LLM-as-a-JudgeTraditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which rely on n-gram overlap, are a poor fit for evaluating the output of modern LLMs.22 They fail to capture semantic meaning or a model's ability to paraphrase or reason in a human-like way. This limitation has given rise to a new and powerful evaluation paradigm: using a powerful LLM as an evaluation judge.22This approach, often called "LLM-as-a-judge," leverages a robust language model to evaluate the RAG system's output on a wide range of criteria.17 By providing the judge LLM with the user query, the retrieved context, and the generated answer, it can assess dimensions such as faithfulness, relevancy, and even custom requirements like response format or tone.17 This method is highly effective because it moves beyond simple string matching to a more nuanced, semantically aware assessment that more closely aligns with human judgment.22The development of this paradigm is leading to a fundamental architectural shift. Instead of requiring constant human annotation and manual metric calculation, a powerful LLM can be used as an oracle to evaluate and provide actionable feedback on a RAG system's performance at scale. This ability to automate evaluation in a reference-free manner is critical for dynamic, continuous deployments where a static ground-truth dataset is not feasible.23 The emergence of specialized LLMs, such as Lynx and Glider, that are explicitly trained to act as judges further validates this approach as a dedicated and promising sub-field of AI.22 This development marks the beginning of a self-correcting AI ecosystem, where one AI system can be used to evaluate and optimize another, thereby accelerating development and improving reliability far beyond what was previously possible.Table 3: Multidimensional RAG Evaluation MetricsMetric CategoryKey MetricDescriptionWhen to UseRetrieval MetricsPrecision@kProportion of relevant documents among the top k retrieved.When ensuring the retrieved information is highly relevant is critical.MRRMeasures how high the first relevant document appears in the search results.For systems where the position of the single best result is paramount.NDCGAccounts for both the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents.When the quality of the entire ranked list, not just the top result, is important.Generation MetricsFaithfulnessMeasures if the response is completely supported by the retrieved context.As a paramount metric to quantify and reduce hallucinations.Answer RelevancyAssesses if the generated answer is on-topic and relevant to the query.To ensure the system is not generating off-topic or irrelevant responses.CompletenessMeasures whether the response answers all parts of the query.To diagnose if the retriever found all necessary information.UtilizationMeasures the extent to which the retrieved context was used in the response.To determine if the LLM ignored or misused the provided context.5. Critical Challenges and The Road AheadDespite the advancements in RAG evaluation, significant challenges remain. These limitations highlight the gap between a system that performs well on a benchmark and one that provides reliable, valuable service in the real world.5.1. The Persistent Problem of HallucinationsEven with the use of RAG, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported or contradictory claims into their responses.24 The retrieved context, while intended to ground the LLM, does not fully eliminate the risk of hallucination.25 This is a critical risk, especially in high-stakes domains like legal research or medicine where false information can have serious consequences.9To address this, a new corpus named RAGTruth has been developed.26 RAGTruth is a large-scale dataset specifically tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in RAG scenarios.26 It consists of nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs, all meticulously annotated to identify hallucination intensity.26 This dataset provides a crucial benchmark for developing and testing hallucination detection methodologies, offering a path forward for building more trustworthy generative AI systems.255.2. From Static to Dynamic EvaluationA major limitation of many traditional RAG benchmarks is that they are static datasets, representing a fixed snapshot of a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia from a specific date.27 This creates a significant problem: a model can overfit to this fixed corpus, leading to poor performance in real-world applications where knowledge is constantly evolving.27 In a dynamic environment, a model that once performed well may quickly become outdated, providing irrelevant or incorrect information as its knowledge base shifts.28To address this critical flaw, a new benchmark, DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), was introduced.27 DRAGON is the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems, built on a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents.27 Its architecture is designed to reflect realistic usage patterns and mitigates the risk of overfitting by ensuring the knowledge base is always current.27 This approach is crucial for building robust and reliable RAG systems that can adapt to the ever-changing nature of information.275.3. Common Evaluation PitfallsBeyond the limitations of specific datasets, the provided research highlights a number of common pitfalls in RAG evaluation that can mislead practitioners.29 These include:Overemphasis on Generation Metrics: A reliance on metrics like BLEU or ROUGE can provide a false sense of confidence in a system's performance by ignoring critical retrieval errors.30Lack of Ground Truth: In many real-world use cases, a clear ground truth for retrieval does not exist, which complicates evaluation and makes it difficult to judge the contextual relevance of retrieved documents.30Misalignment with User Needs: A system can achieve a high score on a benchmark but still fail to satisfy users due to issues such as excessive latency, poor response specificity, or failure to adhere to formatting requirements.31Poor Data Quality: The quality of the RAG system is ultimately constrained by the quality of its knowledge base.33 Issues like bad chunking, vague content, or outdated information in the source documents can cripple the entire pipeline, regardless of the model's quality.29The existence of these challenges demonstrates a significant gap between achieving a high score on a benchmark and building a production-ready system. A model that performs well on a static, fact-based benchmark may still struggle in the real world due to issues like hallucination (a metric the benchmark may not even measure), degradation over time (a problem for static datasets), or user experience issues (a concern beyond simple accuracy scores). This reveals that successful RAG evaluation is not about optimizing for a single number. It is a holistic, multi-faceted process that must include a variety of metrics, an understanding of the data's limitations, and an active effort to bridge the gap between academic evaluation and production reality.6. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations6.1. ConclusionThe field of RAG and GraphRAG evaluation is rapidly maturing, moving from simple, open-domain benchmarks to sophisticated, domain-specific, and dynamic evaluation frameworks. The evidence suggests that a successful approach must move beyond a singular focus on performance scores to a multi-dimensional, diagnostic methodology. The emergence of LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and dynamic datasets signals a shift toward a more robust, automated, and continuous evaluation paradigm that more closely aligns with the demands of real-world applications.6.2. Strategic Recommendations for PractitionersBased on the analysis of the current evaluation landscape, the following strategic recommendations are offered to practitioners working with RAG and GraphRAG systems:Adopt a Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Approach: Do not rely on a single dataset or metric to evaluate an entire RAG system. Systematically evaluate both the retrieval (e.g., MRR, NDCG) and generation (e.g., Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy) components separately before assessing their combined performance.Prioritize Faithfulness as a Core Metric: In production environments, reducing hallucinations is paramount. Use dedicated datasets like RAGTruth and leverage frameworks that prioritize groundedness as a core metric to ensure the generated responses are trustworthy and supported by the source material.Embrace LLM-as-a-Judge: Leverage modern, reference-free evaluation tools to automate and scale the evaluation pipeline. This approach provides nuanced, diagnostic feedback that traditional metrics cannot, accelerating the process of identifying and fixing pipeline failures.Prepare for Dynamism: Acknowledge the limitations of static datasets. Consider building small, dynamic benchmarks that are regularly updated to reflect the real-world evolution of the knowledge base, thereby preventing model overfitting and performance degradation over time.Focus on the Entire Pipeline: A RAG system is a pipeline, not a single model. Use diagnostic metrics such as completeness and utilization to pinpoint specific failure points, whether they lie in the initial chunking strategy, the embedding model, the retrieval mechanism, or the final generation step.
